I am a Senior Research Fellow in Uncertainty Quantification in the [SEAVEA](https://www.seavea-project.org/) project in the Department of Statistical Science at [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/statistics/department-statistical-science). I am focused mainly on multi-physics problems and the propagation of uncertainties when coupled models are emulated.

Before my appointment here, I worked at [Brunel University London](https://www.brunel.ac.uk/computer-science) as a part of the same [SEAVEA](https://www.seavea-project.org/) and [STAMINA](https://stamina-project.eu/) projects and co-developed the [FACS](https://facs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) model for infectious diseases and the [FabSim3](https://fabsim3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) automation toolkit for complex simulation tasks. I have also worked at the [University of South Florida](https://health.usf.edu/publichealth) in Tampa, Florida on creating a digital twin for infectious disease modeling in cities, and at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) on analyzing swarm dynamics and collective behavior models.

During my PhD and undergraduate days, I have worked on various aspects of complex dynamical systems such as extreme events, synchronization, routes to chaos in discrete maps, and coupled networks.
